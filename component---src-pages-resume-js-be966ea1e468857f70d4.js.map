That means,\n            // x=0 is the left edge, x=1 is the right edge, y=0 is the top edge and y=1 is the\n            // bottom edge.\n            //\n            // A naive approach would use the original angle for these calculations.  Say we'd\n            // like to draw a gradient angled at 45deg in a 100x400 box.  When we use\n            // objectBoundingBox, the renderer will draw it in a 1x1 *square* box, and then\n            // scale that to the desired dimensions.  The 45deg angle will look more like 70deg\n            // after scaling.  SVG (http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#LinearGradients) says\n            // the following:\n            //\n            //     When gradientUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\" and 'gradientTransform' is the\n            //     identity matrix, the normal of the linear gradient is perpendicular to the\n            //     gradient vector in object bounding box space (i.e., the abstract coordinate\n            //     system where (0,0) is at the top/left of the object bounding box and (1,1) is\n            //     at the bottom/right of the object bounding box). When the object's bounding\n            //     box is not square, the gradient normal which is initially perpendicular to\n            //     the gradient vector within object bounding box space may render\n            //     non-perpendicular relative to the gradient vector in user space. If the\n            //     gradient vector is parallel to one of the axes of the bounding box, the\n            //     gradient normal will remain perpendicular. This transformation is due to\n            //     application of the non-uniform scaling transformation from bounding box space\n            //     to user space.\n            //\n            // which is an extremely long and confusing way to tell what I just said above.\n            //\n            // For this reason we need to apply the reverse scaling to the original angle, so\n            // that when it'll finally be rendered it'll actually be at the desired slope.
